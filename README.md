# Linear-regression
This model has several versions. Built by me when i was 14 years old.

The last version has one problem. Only reliable points and degree gives reliable results. 

I think i know why. Since my model computes the gradient of each degree, then updates them all.
This is why there is no ptoblem at the fitst degree.

I will try to compute the gradient and update it simultaneously for every degree.
Hope this will make a difference. 

unfortunately. it didn't.
